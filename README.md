## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **QA Engineer** passionate about delivering high-quality software through intelligent testing strategies and automation. With a strong foundation in both **testing methodologies** and **development practices**, I bridge the gap between QA and development teams to ensure robust, scalable, and reliable applications.

Before specializing in QA, I gained hands-on experience in game development using **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**, which strengthened my technical understanding, problem-solving, and attention to detail — skills I now apply to testing complex systems and automation workflows.

I thrive in collaborative environments where **automation**, **performance testing**, and **continuous integration** drive efficiency. My development understanding allows me to contribute to code-level testing, debug complex issues, and optimize CI/CD pipelines—making me a versatile asset in modern agile teams.

**Core focus:** Test automation frameworks, API testing, performance engineering, and fostering a culture of quality from development to deployment.
